# AB-Testing-Project

# Overview
AB Testing Project via Udacity's data analyst nanodegree. Udacity provided a data set simulating the performance of two versions of a website. My taks for the project was to run an AB Test on the user engagement data to calculate if there was a statistcal difference between the two pages.

In my report, I conducted my analysis using boot strapping methods, conducted a one tailed test, use machine learning to run a logistical regression test, and finally uses stats model to run a z-test to examine the user engagement with various statistical models.
