# AB-Testing-Project

AB Testing Project via Udacity's data analyst nanodegree. I looked at artificial simulated data to determine if a
hypothetical new web page outperforms the old page. Conducted analysis using boot strapping methdos to conduct a one tailed test,
used machine learning to do a logistical regression test, and used stats model to run a z-test.
